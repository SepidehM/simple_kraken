# simple_kraken

Overview
--------
In this project, we have tried to develop the [kraken](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/) article with C++ language in more simple way and it can run Linux and  Mac OS.


Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignment or machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation programs. Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.

Installation
------------
if you want use this package, you should install [Jellyfish](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish) package and g++ version 11 or higher.

Usage
------------
Instruction of use are available in the [doc](https://github.com/SepidehM/simple_kraken/tree/master/doc) directory.
